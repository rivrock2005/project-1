          <h2>Portfolio Concept</h2>
          <p>
            I have had many experiences in my life from being a
            Firefighter/Paramedic, to being a small business owner, a father and an
            adrenaline junky and now designing websites. Most of my experiences
            comes from owning my own business and knowing what its like to be on a
            budget and knowing just how important it is the have a presence on
            the internet. I like building websites that are easy to read, easy
              to navigate and draw customers back to them.

    <h2>Course Goals</h2>
    <p>
      After having some pretty serious health issues I am here to reinvent
      myself. I am 49 years old and embarking on a brand new career. My end goal
      is to be able to work remotely but will work any position to gain the
      experience needed to obtain my goal.
