    <h4>My Story</h4>
      <P>
        It all started at the University of Nevada Reno My freshman
        year of college. When I met some friends that took me whitewater
        rafting and yes I was hooked so I got a summer jod as a guide. That led
        to me getting my EMT certification and eventually into paramedic school.
        After 10 years of working as a paramedic I had a chance to buy the
        rafting company I worked for, for the past 20 years. The first thing I
        realized was this company had no web presence. So my business partner
        read a book on HTML and designed our first website. My partner did a
        great job but it was a flop we really new nothing about designing
        websites so we left it up to the professionals. our business started
        to get up higher in the ranking and our business started to thrive.
        So I recently sold that business went back to school and now I am
        here to help your business reach its most potential.
